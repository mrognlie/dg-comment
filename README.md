# dg-comment
This repository has Python code for my comment on [Debortoli and Gal√≠ (NBER Macro Annual 2024)](https://crei.cat/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dg_tank_may2024.pdf). It requires the [sequence-space Jacobian toolkit](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) to run.

To replicate the figures and results in my comment, run the Jupyter notebook `dg_comment_results.ipynb`, which also calls on the helper Python module `dg_comment.py`. The [comment itself is available here](http://mattrognlie.com/dg_comment.pdf).
